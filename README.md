Project: From SAD to ASR on the Fearless Steps Data
===================================================

Overview
--------

This project focuses on developing an autonomous speech recognition system using the Fearless Steps - 02 (FS-02) Corpus from NASA's Apollo missions. The system comprises three main sub-tasks: Speaker Activity Detection (SAD), Speaker Identity Detection (SID), and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).

Objectives
----------

*   **SAD**: Differentiate tangible speech from non-speech in audio, achieving a DCF of 2.44% on the FS-02 Development dataset.
*   **SID**: Identify speakers from voice attributes, reaching a Top-5 Accuracy of 91.65% and an overall Accuracy of 76.89%.
*   **ASR**: Incorporate speaker identification into an end-to-end speech recognition system, achieving a WER of 32.9% with the Baseline Transformer model.

Integration
-----------

*   **Speaker Diarization (SD)**: Combined temporal information from SAD with speaker predictions from SID, achieving a DER of 56.78%.
*   **Enhanced ASR**: Improved ASR with SAD information, reaching a WER of 59.4%.

Technologies Used
-----------------

*   Neural Networks: ResNet, LSTM, Transformer Model
*   Clustering Algorithms: DBSCAN, Mean Shift
*   Evaluation Metrics: DCF, WER, DER
